### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Me
- I'm Erik, working everyday to become a software developer.
- I'm not passionate about my work, but I'm having fun working on it, that's all there is to it.
- I'm trillingual in French, English and Russian, my Russian is good but lacks vocabulary, spent 20 years in France so I know the stuff, and English is meh, I just need to speak it more often.

# Skills
- I finished the common core of 42 so I've got some solid foundations of C, C++, Python, Javascript, HTML and CSS.
- I also toyed with docker and django and built some cool projects that you can find in my repo.
- Right now I'm working on a React+FastAPI project by myself, because why not.

# Hobbies
- Apart from code, I like to read, workout and cook. There is no better sport than badminton.
- I also like to learn new stuff, like a new language (both code and human) or instrument, or just speak to interesting people.

# Socials
- I don't really use any social media, I don't like it. But you can reach me on <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/erik-avilov/'>LinkedIn</a>.

##### i also really like pigeons
